**How do I login?**

There is now a login dialog in version 1.0b6.  Please download that version.

**Your design sucks, can't you make it better?**

I plan on redoing the interface in version 1.1 & 2.0, but I'm no graphic designer.  If you think you can make it look better or put things more efficiently, please send me your designs!  Its just plain html, but if your just a designer and not a programmer, send me your vision and I'll see what I can do.

**Can't you release faster?**

I currently am a student, a boyfriend, and have a couple other projects I'm working on concurrently.  I code when I can and try to get releases out according to schedule.  If you really can't wait for a feature, you can always request beta versions or even alpha versions if you're really desperate.
